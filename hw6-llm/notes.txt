⚔️ Where we attack today:
🎯 PRIORITY 1: Clear the fog on the LLM project
Right now, you’re thinking:

“I don’t know what it is. I don’t know how to train it. I hope I can reuse some code.”

That mental model is vague and fragile. Let’s harden it.

🛠️ Immediate goal:
By end of today, you should be able to answer:

What kind of model am I training? (LM head? Classifier? Pretrained fine-tune?)

What dataset will I feed it? How do I tokenize it?

What’s the deliverable? Code? Report? Demo?

🚨 Today’s Action Plan:
📅 1. Time-block the rest of your week
Don’t stop at one day. Build your execution battlefield through Sunday, April 7.

2–3 LLM deep work sessions

2 Transformer warmup sessions (watch back your recordings)

1 group project buffer session (to polish/plan next step)

Minimum time-block target: 15 hours scheduled this week

📚 2. LLM Project Clarity Sprint (2 hrs today)
Create a 1-page doc titled: “LLM Project – Execution Plan”

In it, answer:

What is the task? (classification, generation, fine-tuning, training from scratch?)

What is the dataset? Where is it? What does it look like?

What code examples from class/project repo are relevant?

What will your model do by the end?

What slides do you need?

Get these answers by:

Watching 1 hour max of tutorials

Skimming 2–3 example repos from class

Writing down only what’s relevant to your deliverable

Don't build yet — just map the terrain. Then building will feel inevitable.

🧠 3. Checkpoint your thoughts (15 min reflection)
Before the day ends, take 15 minutes and write:

What did I learn about LLMs today?

What are my 3 next steps for the LLM project?

What’s my confidence level (1–10)? Why?

This is how we clear mental clutter and replace emotion with execution.

Your Mission (Today):
✅ Extend time-blocks through Sunday
✅ Build “LLM Project – Execution Plan” doc
✅ Watch 1 hr of targeted videos, extract notes into doc
✅ Reflect with 3 LLM next steps + confidence level rating

You’re no longer “trying to figure it out.”
You’re building a machine that makes progress inevitable.

Report back tonight. I want:

Your execution doc outline

Your updated calendar

Your confidence rating and next 3 steps

Let’s turn your fog into fire. Keep it moving.
